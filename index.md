I am a software engineer at [Tallarium Ltd](http://www.tallarium.com), a FinTech
startup in London, UK.

I hail originally from [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow), but have
also lived in [Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta),
[Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne),
[Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford) and
[San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco).

Soon I will think of something else to put here...
